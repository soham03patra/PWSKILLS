    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and the Probability Density Function (PDF) are two statistical functions that describe the probability distribution of a random variable. A random variable is a variable whose value is not known to the function, but depends on the outcome of an experiment. For example, the number of heads obtained when flipping a coin is a random variable.\n",

For example, the number of students in a class, the number of dice rolls that result in a six, or the number of goals scored in a soccer match are discrete random variables. The PMF assigns a probability to each possible value of the discrete random variable, such that the sum of all probabilities is equal to one. The PMF can be represented by a table, a formula, or a graph."

    "\n",
    "The normal distribution has some useful properties that make it easy to work with. For example, it is symmetric, meaning that half of the values fall below the mean and half above the mean. It also follows the empirical rule, which states that about 68% of the values are within one standard deviation from the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations. This rule helps us estimate the probability of events involving a normal variable."

    "The Bernoulli distribution is the simplest discrete probability distribution that has only two possible outcomes: success or failure. For example, if you toss a coin, there are only two possible outcomes: heads or tails. If you consider heads as success and tails as failure, then the probability of success is p and the probability of failure is q = 1 - p. The Bernoulli distribution describes the probability of getting either outcome in a single trial. For example, if p = 0.5, then the probability of getting heads or tails is 0.5 each.\n",

    "The binomial distribution is a generalization of the Bernoulli distribution that describes the probability of getting a certain number of successes in a fixed number of trials, where each trial is independent and has the same probability of success as the Bernoulli distribution. For example, if you toss a coin 10 times, there are 10 independent trials, each with a probability of success p = 0.5. The binomial distribution tells you the probability of getting any number of heads from 0 to 10 in these 10 trials.\n",
