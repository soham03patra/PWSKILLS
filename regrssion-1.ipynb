    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function of a model by iteratively adjusting its parameters.

    "Polynomial regression is preferred over linear regression in the following situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonlinear Relationships: When the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is nonlinear, polynomial regression can provide a better fit to the data. It allows for the modeling of curved or quadratic relationships that linear regression cannot capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility in Modeling: Polynomial regression is suitable when you want to model complex patterns in the data, such as curves or peaks. It offers flexibility in modeling by allowing the inclusion of higher-order polynomial terms to better represent the underlying relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis: In exploratory data analysis, polynomial regression can be useful for examining the shape of the relationship between variables and identifying potential nonlinearities. It can provide insights into the nature of the data before building more complex models."
