    "Using accuracy as the sole evaluation metric for classification tasks has several limitations, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imbalanced Datasets**: Accuracy can be misleading when the dataset is imbalanced, meaning that one class is much more prevalent than the others. In such cases, a model that simply predicts the majority class for all instances can achieve high accuracy, even though it fails to correctly classify instances from minority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Misleading in Cost-Sensitive Applications**: In some applications, misclassifying certain instances may have higher costs than others. For example, in medical diagnosis, misclassifying a severe disease as not present (false negative) can have more severe consequences than misclassifying a healthy individual as having the disease (false positive). Accuracy does not take into account the cost associated with different types of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Doesn't Capture Model Confidence**: Accuracy does not capture the confidence of the model in its predictions. For example, a model that is unsure about its predictions but still makes them can have the same accuracy as a model that is confident in its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Doesn't Provide Insights into Misclassifications**: Accuracy does not provide information about which classes are being misclassified and why. Understanding these misclassifications can help improve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these limitations, it is important to consider using additional evaluation metrics in conjunction with accuracy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Precision and Recall**: Precision measures the proportion of positive predictions that are correct, while recall measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly predicted. These metrics are useful for imbalanced datasets and cost-sensitive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **F1 Score**: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. It is particularly useful when there is an uneven class distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix provides a more detailed breakdown of the model's predictions, showing the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. This can help identify which classes are being misclassified and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ROC Curve and AUC**: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various thresholds. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) provides a single metric to compare different models. It is particularly useful when evaluating binary classifiers.\n",
