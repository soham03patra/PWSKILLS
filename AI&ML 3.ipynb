    "The filter method is a technique used in feature selection, which is a process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, attributes) from a larger set of features to be used in building a predictive model or conducting an analysis. The filter method involves evaluating the importance or relevance of individual features independently of any specific machine learning algorithm. It's called a \"filter\" because it acts as a preprocessing step to filter out features that may be less informative or redundant before feeding the data into a machine learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the filter method works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Scoring: In the filter method, each feature is assigned a score or rank based on some statistical measure or criterion. Common scoring methods used include correlation, chi-squared test, information gain, and variance threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: Features are scored independently of each other and the target variable. This means that the score of a feature is calculated without considering its relationship with other features or how well it might contribute to predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threshold: A threshold is set based on some criterion, such as selecting the top N highest-scoring features or setting a threshold value for the scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: Features that meet the threshold criteria are selected and retained for further analysis or model building, while those below the threshold are discarded.\n"

    "Wrapper Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation with a Specific Model: In the Wrapper method, features are evaluated in the context of a specific machine learning algorithm. The algorithm is trained and evaluated multiple times using different subsets of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Performance: The primary criterion for selecting features is how well they improve the performance of the chosen machine learning algorithm. Features are selected based on their contribution to model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or other relevant evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative Process: The Wrapper method involves an iterative process where different subsets of features are tested in the chosen model. This can be computationally expensive, as it requires training and evaluating the model for every combination of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prone to Overfitting: Due to its model-specific nature, the Wrapper method can lead to overfitting if not used carefully. It might select features that improve performance on the training data but fail to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter Method:\n",

    "LASSO: This is a linear regression method with L1 regularization, which penalizes the absolute values of the coefficients. This causes some coefficients to shrink to zero, effectively discarding the corresponding features.\n",

    "Lack of Consideration for Feature Interactions: The Filter method evaluates features independently of each other and the target variable.
