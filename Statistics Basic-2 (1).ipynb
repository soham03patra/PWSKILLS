    "   - Covariance: Covariance measures the extent and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It is calculated by averaging the product of the deviations of each variable from their respective means. The value of covariance is not standardized and can be positive, negative, or zero. A positive covariance indicates a positive relationship, a negative covariance indicates a negative relationship, and a covariance of zero indicates no linear relationship.\n",

Correlation provides a more interpretable and standardized measure than covariance.\n",
