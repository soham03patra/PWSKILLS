The model learns from the input features and the output labels of the training data, and tries to minimize the error or loss function.

The model does not have access to the test data during training, so it cannot learn from it or adjust its parameters based on it. The test set is important because it provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model can perform on new data that it has never seen before. The test set should only be used once at the end of the training process, and not for tuning or selecting the model.\n",
