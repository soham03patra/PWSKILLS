    "5. **Average the Silhouette Coefficients**: Calculate the average Silhouette Coefficient for the entire dataset to obtain a single score representing the clustering quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Repeat for different numbers of clusters**: Repeat the above steps for different numbers of clusters to determine the optimal number of clusters based on the Silhouette Coefficient.\n",

    "It's important to note that the Silhouette Coefficient may not be as straightforward to interpret in the context of hierarchical clustering compared to other clustering algorithms. This is because hierarchical clustering produces a clustering hierarchy, and the optimal number of clusters may vary depending on the level at which the dendrogram is cut. Additionally, the Silhouette Coefficient may be influenced by the specific method used to cut the dendrogram and the distance metric used in the hierarchical clustering algorithm. Therefore, when using the Silhouette Coefficient to evaluate hierarchical clustering algorithms, it's important to consider these factors and interpret the results accordingly."
