    "Estimation statistics is a data analysis framework that uses a combination of effect sizes, confidence intervals, precision planning, and meta-analysis to plan experiments, analyze data and interpret results1 It complements hypothesis testing approaches such as null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), by going beyond the question of whether an effect is present or not, and provides information about how large an effect is.\n",

    "Student’s t-distribution is a continuous probability distribution that describes the behavior of a sample mean when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small. It is also known as Student’s t-test or simply the t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is similar to the normal distribution, which is also a bell-shaped curve that is symmetric around the mean. However, the t-distribution has heavier tails than the normal distribution, which means that it has more probability mass in the extreme values. The shape of the t-distribution depends on a parameter called the degrees of freedom, which is related to the sample size. The larger the degrees of freedom, the closer the t-distribution is to the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is used when we want to make inferences about a population mean based on a sample mean, but we do not know the population standard deviation. This is often the case in real-world situations, where we only have access to a limited amount of data. The t-distribution allows us to calculate confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests for the population mean, taking into account the uncertainty and variability of the sample data."
